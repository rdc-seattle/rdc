                <p>Relay Dance Collective wants to expand who gets to see, experience, and participate in Seattle dance. We aim to bring high-caliber, accessible works to the stage where our artists honor the tradition of dancing and share the joy that it brings. Our goal is that you, the audience, are left feeling welcomed to our art form, and are moved (or even entertained!)<br><br> In addition to producing excellent performances each year, RDC aims to extend its mission outside of the theater. Whether it's providing ballet field trips for 1st graders or teaching free adult jazz classes, RDC looks for new ways each year to break down barriers. All are welcome to experience the power and potential of movement.</p>

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Relay Dance Collective strives to provide professional opportunities for Northwest dancers, seek out collaboration, give back to the community, and bring new audiences and participants to the art form. Since dancing together as children, the four co-founders have formed distinct identities as women, and have had life experiences that add depth and soul to a strong foundation in classical ballet and modern dance. As a collective, we are no longer simply performers, but artists shaping our own work, relaying the power of dance to others.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Relay Dance Collective creates original works, and has performed pieces by original members of Spectrum Dance Theater; Xaviera Vandermay, Artistic Director of 3rd Shift Dance; Paula Peters and Mary Kay Bisignano-Vadino. We're known for collaborating with other artists, dance companies, and musicians.</p>
